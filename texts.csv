"As I develop the awakening mind I praise the Buddhas as they shine I bow before you as I travel my path To join your ranks, I make my full-time task For the sake of all beings I seek The enlightened mind that I know I'll reap Respect to Shantideva and all the others Who brought down the Dharma for the sisters and brothers I give thanks for this world as a place to learn And for this human body that I know I've earned And my deepest thanks to all sentient beings For without them, there would be no place to learn what I'm seeing There's nothing here that's not been said before But I put it down now so that I'll be sure To solidify my own views And I'll be glad if it helps anyone else out too If others disrespect me or give me flak I'll stop and think before I react Knowing that they're going through insecure stages I'll take the opportunity to exercise patience I'll see it as a chance to help the other person Nip it in the bud before it can worsen A chance for me to be strong and sure As I think on the Buddhas who have come before As I praise and respect the good they've done Knowing love can conquer hate in every situation We need other people in order to create The circumstances for the learning that we're here to generate Situations that bring up our deepest fears So we can work to release them until they're cleared Therefore it only makes sense To thank our enemies despite their intent The Bodhisattva path is one of power and strength A strength from within to go the length Seeing others are as important as myself I strive for a happiness of mental wealth With the interconnectedness that we share as one Every action that we take affects everyone So in deciding for what a situation calls There is a path for the good for all I try to make my every action for that highest good With the altruistic wish to achieve Buddhahood So I pledge here before everyone who's listening To try to make my every action for the good of all beings For the rest of my lifetimes and even beyond I vow to do my best, to do no harm And in times of doubt, I can think on the Dharma And the Enlightened Ones who've graduated Samsara",hiphop

The teacher got upset and she screamed out ""No"" It's off to the principal's office you go Twelve o'clock comes with mass hysteria Everybody rushes down to the cafeteria Picked up my tray to have Thursday's lunch And when I tried the applesauce, I heard it crunch I'm running up the stairs with a front tooth broken The nurse just laughed and says, ""you must be jokin'"" I looked up at her with a smile on my face No joke 'cause my front tooth is out of place So I walk through school with ice on my lip A nurse's late pass like a gun on my hip My books are real heavy, I walk and I'm dragging it No school lunch next week, I'm brown-bagging it Forget class, I'ma shoot some ball With a late pass I've got no trouble at all But then the nurse walks up and says, ""Whaddya know? It's off to the principal's office you go"" Recess Passing notes is my favorite pastime I can't wait to find a girl to pass mine to To express my feelings Give me a week, me and the girl will be dealin Now one young lady was looking at me I said, ""Hi, my name is Marvin, known as Young MC"" But then the bell rang and the teacher came in And that's when the game of passing notes will begin I wrote the first note, told her she was fine And I hope that the two of us could spend some time She wrote me back and told me, ""You're fine too, I'd love to go on a date and spend some time with you"" So then I sat there reeling and looking at the ceiling Words can't express the way that I was feeling Then I thought to myself, The sure way to get her Is to write another note, oh yes, a love letter When I finished the note it was ready to pass The teacher took it and read it right in front of the class She read it word by word and line by line And everybody who was laughing was a friend of mine Even my girl was laughing, it was too late No need to write another note, 'cause there would be no date The teacher looked at me and I said, ""I know, It's off to the principal's office I go"" Yo, you think this bad?

Baseball cap and flannel arms Dancing with a voodoo doll Sweat rolls down the old guitar Seeing things the way they are A crooked look lay on his brow Beside a wisecrack whiskey mouth Tip up the bottle and pour him out Here he is again Capman bootman Lay it down horizontal lean slip a finger across the bar Whip the high note frantic Skip the manic songwriter's pulled-down rhyme Then leave'em hanging halfway home Surprise is not the same thing twice Music is not your boiled rice Here he is again Capman bootman Leave the making sense behind Zen bazooka buddha joe Cornmeal and guitar strings Hates to fly to land and lives to sing He's got his cap and boots and coat He's got his box of songs he wrote I wonder if he'll find that note Here he is again Capman bootman,blues
